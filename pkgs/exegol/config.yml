volumes:
    # The my-resources volume is a storage space dedicated to the user to customize his environment and tools. This volume can be shared across all exegol containers.
    # Attention! The permissions of this folder (and subfolders) will be updated to share read/write rights between the host (user) and the container (root). Do not modify this path to a folder on which the permissions (chmod) should not be modified.

    # Exegol resources are data and static tools downloaded in addition to docker images. These tools are complementary and are accessible directly from the host.
